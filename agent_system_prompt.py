"""System-prompt assembly for :class:`AIAgent`.

The agent's system prompt is built once per session and reused across all
turns — only context compression triggers a rebuild.  This keeps the
upstream prefix cache warm.  See ``hermes-agent-dev``'s
``references/system-prompt-invariant.md`` for the invariants and
``references/self-improvement-loop.md`` for how the background-review
fork inherits the cached prompt verbatim.

Three tiers are joined with ``\\n\\n``:

* ``stable``   — identity (SOUL.md or DEFAULT_AGENT_IDENTITY), tool
  guidance, computer-use guidance, nous subscription block, tool-use
  enforcement guidance + per-model operational guidance, skills prompt,
  alibaba model-name workaround, environment hints, platform hints.
* ``context``  — caller-supplied ``system_message`` plus context files
  (AGENTS.md / .cursorrules / etc.) discovered under ``TERMINAL_CWD``.
* ``volatile`` — memory snapshot, USER.md profile, external memory
  provider block, timestamp/session/model/provider line.

Pure helpers that read the agent's state.  AIAgent keeps thin forwarders.
